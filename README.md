<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project? 
- Need to create a model to evaulate the house price 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? 
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- What is the dataset that is being used? 
- Housing price dataset

## Conclusions
Performaed Model Building using Ridege and Lasso regression.
Ridge regression model is better than the lasso model
